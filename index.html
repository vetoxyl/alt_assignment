                <p>The objective of this task is to set up a web server and deploy a simple landing page to demonstrate your team's capabilities to potential investors. To achieve this, you will provision a Linux server on a cloud platform like AWS, install a web server such as Apache or Nginx, and create a basic HTML page that includes your name, a project title (“Welcome to [Your Name] Landing Page”), a brief project description, and your full bio with interesting details. Once the HTML page is created, you will deploy it on the server, configure the server to allow HTTP traffic on port 80, and provide the public IP address or URL so the page can be accessed from any browser. Deliverables include the public IP address or URL of your web page, a screenshot showing your HTML page in a browser, and clear, step-by-step documentation in a README.md file hosted in a Git repository, detailing how you provisioned the server, installed the web server, deployed the HTML page, and configured networking. For extra credit, you can optionally configure HTTPS for your web server using a free SSL certificate like Let’s Encrypt.</p>

                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>I've always been fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. As a cloud computing student at NOUN, I'm on a mission to understand and harness the power of the cloud. Growing up, I was captivated by computers and technology, and I knew early on that I wanted to dive deep into this field. Cloud computing has become the perfect outlet for my curiosity and creativity.</p>
                <p>From a young age, I loved tinkering with gadgets and exploring how things worked. This natural curiosity led me to study computer science, where I quickly realized the transformative potential of cloud computing. For me, it's not just about technology for technology's sake; it's about using these tools to create solutions that can genuinely make a difference in people's lives.</p>
                <p>At School, I've thrived in a variety of challenging courses, ranging from Cloud Infrastructure and Cloud Security to Big Data Analytics and DevOps. These classes have expanded my technical knowledge and taught me the importance of collaboration and critical thinking. Whether it's a group project or a solo assignment, I approach each task with enthusiasm and a desire to learn something new.</p>
                <p>What excites me most about cloud computing is the chance to get hands-on experience. I've worked on projects ranging from building scalable web applications to setting up secure cloud environments for small businesses. One of my favorite experiences was an internship at Nova, where I got to work alongside experienced engineers to solve real-world problems. There's something incredibly satisfying about seeing a project through from conception to implementation.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I've picked up a diverse set of skills. I'm comfortable coding in languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, and I'm proficient with cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. I'm particularly proud of my certifications, such as AWS Certified Solutions Architect, which I see as milestones on my journey to mastering the cloud. But more than just collecting credentials, I'm driven by a genuine love for learning and a desire to stay on the cutting edge of technology.</p>
                <p>Outside of my studies, I'm an active member of the NOUN Cloud Computing Club. I enjoy sharing my knowledge through workshops and have even mentored fellow students who are new to the field. I'm passionate about making technology accessible to everyone and believe in the importance of diversity in tech. To this end, I've been involved in initiatives aimed at encouraging more people from underrepresented backgrounds to explore careers in technology.As I look to the future, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I dream of becoming a cloud solutions architect, where I can design cutting-edge solutions that leverage the latest advancements in AI and machine learning. For me, cloud computing isn't just a career path; it's a way to make a tangible impact on the world. When I'm not immersed in the world of cloud computing, I love spending time outdoors. I find hiking to be a great way to clear my mind and find inspiration. I also enjoy reading science fiction novels, which fuel my imagination and give me a glimpse into what the future might hold.</p>
